## SM Processing.Rmd

My master R markdown file was used when drafting my code, running stat tests, generating figures, and more. With no prior experience in coding (any langauge) I learned what I needed this year from my mxntor, lab mates, and the internet. Any respectful tips, suggestions, edits, etc. are more than welcome.

## plate_maps.xlsx

This Excel sheet contains all the plate maps used across the project. 'plate_map1' and 'plate_map2' are the master maps and any additional maps were made in response to errors or changes to the wells as needed.
